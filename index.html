                    primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather
                    than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on

                        <p>A sports car is designed to emphasise handling, performance or thrill of driving. Sports cars
                            originated in Europe in the early 1900s and are currently produced by many manufacturers
                            around
                            the
                            world.

                        <p>Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic
                            performance
                            (car handling), without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and

                            Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader
                            definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying
                            capacity", or that emphasise the "thrill of driving" or are marketed "using the excitement
                            of
                            speed
                            and the glamour of the (race)track" However, other people have more specific definitions,

                            as
                            "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater" or a car with two seats only.</p>

                        <p>A luxury vehicle is intended to provide the driver and passengers with increased comfort, a
                            higher level of equipment and increased perception of quality than regular cars (such as
                            economy cars, which are intended as basic low-cost transportation devices) for an increased
                            price. The term is subjective and can be based on either the qualities of the car itself or
                            the brand image of its manufacturer.

                        <p>Luxury cars costing over US$100,000 (as of 2007) can be considered as "ultra-luxury cars".
                            Examples include the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Maybach 57, Bentley Arnage, and Toyota Century.
                            High-end sports cars which are targeted towards performance rather than luxury are not
                            usually classified as ultra-luxury cars, even when their cost is greater than US$100,000.
                            The history of a brand and the exclusivity of a particular model can result in price
                            premiums compared to luxury cars with similar features from less prestigious manufacturers.
